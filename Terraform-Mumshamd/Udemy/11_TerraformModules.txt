Terraform Modules
=================
Modules are containers for multiple resources that are used together. A module consists of a collection of .tf and/or .tf.json files kept 
together in a directory.

Modules are the main way to package and reuse resource configurations with Terraform.

The Root Module
Every Terraform configuration has at least one module, known as its root module, which consists of the resources defined in the .tf files in the 
main working directory.
