Installting TerraForm
=====================
TerraForm can be downloaded as a single binary or an executable file from the terraformed download section(WWW.terraform.io)
Installing TerraForm is as simple as downloading this file and copying it to the system path.
    $ wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.13.0/terraform_0.13.0_linux_amd64.zip
    $ unzip terraform_0.13.0_linux_amd64.zip
    $ mv terraform /usr/local/bin

Once installed, we can check the version by running the command 
   $ terraform version 
   Terraform v0.13.0
   
TerraForm is supported on Windows, Mac and several other Linux based distributions.

As stated earlier, Terraform uses configuration files, which are written in HCL(Hashicorp Configuration Langiuage) to deploy infrastructure resources.
  HCL â€“ Declarative Language
aws.tf
  resource "aws_instance" "webserver" { ami = "ami-0c2f25c1f66a1ff4d" instance_type = "t2.micro"
  }

These files have a .tf extension and can be created using any text editor such as notepad or notepad++  for windows or command line text editors such as 
Vim or iMac in Linux, or it could be any ID of your choice.

A resource is an object that Terraform manages. 

It could be a file on a local host or it could be a virtual machine on the cloud, such as an EC2 instance, or it could be services like S3 Buckets, 
ECS, Dynamo DB tables, I am users or I am groups, rules, policies, etc. Or it could be resources on major cloud providers such as the compute and app 
engine from GCP ,databaseson Azure ,Azure Active Directory, etc.

There are literally hundreds of resources that can be provisioned across most of the cloud and on premise infrastructure using TerraForm.
